# Car Rental System
This project provides two implementations of a car rental system: one using Python terminal input/output and another using a graphical interface with PySimpleGUI. Both versions allow users to rent cars, return them, and view finance summaries. Below is a detailed description of the systemâ€™s functionality.

## Terminal-Based Car Rental System
The terminal version is menu-driven and operates in a loop, allowing users to perform three main functions:

1. Car Rental:
   The user is shown a table of available cars including their names, availability, rental price per day, and insurance options. The user selects a car, enters the number of rental days, and chooses the type of insurance (Liability or Full). The system then calculates the total rental cost including a 5% tax on the base rental price and displays a detailed breakdown of the bill.
2. Car Return:
   This option allows users to return a car they previously rented. The user selects the type of car, and the system increases its availability count. A confirmation message is displayed upon successful return.
3. Print the Totals:
   This feature calculates and displays total income, insurance collected, and tax accumulated using hardcoded values. These calculations give an overview of the revenue generated by the system.

The program continues to loop until the user decides to exit by selecting 'N' when asked about more operations.

## GUI Based Car Rental System (PySimpleGUI)
The GUI version enhances usability, it includes:

#### Main Window:
  Displays the title "TG Enterprises" and three buttons: Car Rental, Car Return, and Total Finance Detail.

#### Car Rental Window:
  Shows a table of available cars and prompts the user to:
  - Select a car from the table
  - Enter the number of days
  - Choose an insurance type via radio buttons

  When confirmed the system updates car availability and calculates the rental cost, adding the insurance and tax. The rental record is stored internally for financial tracking.
Car Return Window:
  Displays a list of currently rented cars. The user selects one and returns it. The system updates the car's availability and removes the record from the internal list.

#### Total Finance Detail:
  Shows a tabulated summary of all rentals including the car name, days rented, total cost, and insurance type. It also displays the grand total of all rentals Total Income.
The GUI closes when the user exits the main window. All inputs are validated and error-handled to ensure smooth operation.
